<body><h1>1780 RC: Athuonia, capital of Athuon.</h1>
  <p>By my fists, centuries of a wicked scheme have ended now. The noble family of Athuonia had its jubilee approaching. It was an opportunity for new alliances. Like many, I wanted a place among the distinguished family's new favourites. It was in my best interest to have granted permission to build a workshop in their prosperous city and exhibit how we excel in the forges. But the city was betrayed by its queen.</p>
  <p>I awoke from a deep sleep, caused by some vile enchantment, and saw many embalmed bodies. I shattered the Skeleton King's bones and made my armour out of him with my bare hands. I freed those who still had life, but many fell as part of the ritual of this wrecked royalty.</p>
  <p>A young bedel fought alongside me and proved worthy of our sympathy. For his loyalty, I granted him a shield found in the undergrounds of the Veiled Vaults. I gifted him with the best Warhammer anyone could find on these plains, for their folk's standards but not ours, and have now taught him how to behave in battle. Despite his lack of martial proficiency, he knows how to handle wounds and injuries.</p>
  <p>After the defeat of the Onyx Queen, this capital is trying to find new leadership. I was asked to take a position of high trust, which I respectfully declined to accept.Â  The order to which the boy belongs is involved in the city's future.</p>
  <p>We also had the company of a wee elf, much shorter and louder than any faerie child. And the bedel insisted on planting the seed of a strange plant within the city walls.</p>
  <p>My share of the loot has a crown full of jewels and a sword that the people of the lowlands fear wielding.</p>
