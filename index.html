  <h1>1781 RC: Athuonia, capital de Athuon.</h1>
  <p>I was there where the pillars of the cosmos find their beginning and meet their ending with our hands. I travelled to the village of Kar Amel to protect the young beadle. A pointy-hat –Loxocelso– had a list of items to be collected that somehow was a diplomatic mission. This creature, “Aracusco”, was our guide to Ascoleth. And in the district of Magitek, we found a bazaar of wonders. It is a hideous place, full of pointy-ears’ rubbish, kept by a bandit who tried to imprison us in the underground. But I found myself at home.</p>
  <p>Our home turned into a lair for a spider-like monster, poisoning the underground. I dug the earth. I healed it. I blew away the rock. I shaped it and made a passage through those caves, poor in gems and gold. No one could bear that smell of silver. One creature had its body made of silver. Another had its legs made of silver. That bandit was full of vile enchantments. One by one, each and every spider below ceased to infest. I heard that bandit who tried to imprison us. I first silenced his words and then halved his height with my shield. He attacked me again. I struck the bandit with another one of my mighty blows. That bandit without his cantrips and spider-like legs had no honour in combat to present himself with. It bored me to bite my beard. But his fate had already been claimed by my fists. I closed my eyes slowly, almost asleep, and when I opened them again, lying on the ground, there was he. The bandit could not resist my mighty fists. Phoneutriel Latrodecio was free, and we left that plane.</p>
  <p>Back to Kar Amel, Loxocelso was satisfied. I bring the loot of those monsters and shall visit my cousin soon. It was also part of our company that tiny elf that gets louder and louder each day. The young beadle seems to sympathise with it. Perhaps there is something special about it. It was also part of our company, a foreigner, a pointy-eared with six fingers in each hand. He avoids melee combat and brings along some funky animals that seem to be commanded by some imprisonment spell. These elves I have seen are strange, and their appearance is stranger. Little or nothing they seem to share with the folk of Finalar. But I have met only a few of them since elves began to sail the clouds and disturb the peaks of mountains. The tiny elf might not be an elf at all. It is possible that this creature is cursed to look like one and does not remember anything. I could teach it how to fight and guide it out of its burden. Perhaps, I could pay the guild of historians a visit in Athuonia. Considering a more suitable diplomatic ties since the Ingot of Life episode, and with the task given to me in mind, perhaps I should head to Chronert.</p>
  <p>I was informed about crimes within the city walls in Athuonia. I have a feeling that the centuries of evilness of the Queen Onyx did not end with her after all. I must prepare before visiting the ones in custody.</p>

  <h1>1780 RC: Athuonia, capital of Athuon.</h1>
  <p>By my fists, centuries of a wicked scheme have ended now. The noble family of Athuonia had its jubilee approaching. It was an opportunity for new alliances. Like many, I wanted a place among the distinguished family's new favourites. It was in my best interest to have granted permission to build a workshop in their prosperous city and exhibit how we excel in the forges. But the city was betrayed by its queen.</p>
  <p>I awoke from a deep sleep, caused by some vile enchantment, and saw many embalmed bodies. I shattered the Skeleton King's bones and made my armour out of him with my bare hands. I freed those who still had life, but many fell as part of the ritual of this wrecked royalty.</p>
  <p>A young beadle fought alongside me and proved worthy of our sympathy. For his loyalty, I granted him a shield found in the undergrounds of the Veiled Vaults. I gifted him with the best Warhammer anyone could find on these plains, for their folk's standards but not ours, and have now taught him how to behave in battle. Despite his lack of martial proficiency, he knows how to handle wounds and injuries.</p>
  <p>After the defeat of the Onyx Queen, this capital is trying to find new leadership. I was asked to take a position of high trust, which I respectfully declined to accept.  The order to which the boy belongs is involved in the city's future.</p>
  <p>We also had the company of a wee elf, much shorter and louder than any faerie child. The beadle insisted on planting the seed of a strange plant within the city walls.</p>
  <p>My share of the loot has a crown full of jewels and a sword that the people of the lowlands fear wielding.</p>
